      Version control is the act of keeping saved instances of your project each time it is changed. This means you can go back to the project in its state immediately before any given change that was made to it. It is like having a timeline of your project's progress and being able to go back in time to any desired point on the timeline. This allows developers to return to a previous working version of a project in case they have encountered some fatal flaw in their current version. This also allows multiple developers working on a single project to regularly update the project they're working on and submit their changes without completely overwriting what another developer contributed.

       Git helps keep track of changes by keeping each update to your project saved in what is called a "commit." It also allows you to make comments for every commit so that you can keep track of what exactly that commit contributed to the project.

      Github is ideal for storing code for a few reasons. One is that it is stored on the internet so you don't have worry about losing the files on your computer. Another reason is that because Github is online, you can collaborate remotely with other developers, they simply need to sign on to Github to obtain the project files. Lastly, Github is a very organzied way to do version control. The program itself keeps track of everything such as dates and who has submitted what while you simply focus on improving your project.
