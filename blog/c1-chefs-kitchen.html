  <h1>The Devbootcamp Experience</h1>
  <h2>My take on DBC</h2>
  <h4>January 18, 2015</h4>

      Devbootcamp promotes an environment that emphasizes practical skills and working at a personal level over the arbitrary constructs formed by typical educational instituions. This is what drew me to DBC. Having become very disillusioned with my lifestyle in high school (do whatever it takes for straight A's, short-term memorization, faking homework assignments for the sake of a good grade, trying to impress teachers), I dropped out in eleventh grade. DBC rejects this kind of fake environment by doing away with the constructs that sterilize the school environment. Right from the beginning of Phase 0, were are connecting with each other at a personal level and learning without focusing solely on test scores.

        Programming became a hobby of mine a little bit before I quit school. It didn't take long for me to realize that it would be a good fit for me as a professional career due to how much I enjoyed doing it. I noticed a limitation of mine when trying to teach myself however, and it was that I was both frequently scared that I was on the wrong track and scared to reach for help from others. I enrolled in college for one semester majoring in Computer Science. I thought this would be the solution for my shortcomings, but it was most certainly not. The feelings of fear I felt when doing work on my own were increased tenfold at college. Furthermore, I noticed that the most important thing, my enjoyment, was not present. Half of the way through the semester, my brother read an article about Devbootcamp and, knowing my interest in programming, alerted me. I could tell immediately that it would be the perfect fit for me. I could solve my financial difficulties, do what I love, and learn to break out of my shell in one motion.

        My impression has not changed of Devbootcamp, although I feel reminded of a few things I promised myself before I signed up. One is that I would take care of myself physically. I knew that without my health in order, I would not have the ability to work hard and get the most out of DBC. I took this fact too lightly and ended up getting sick this first week. The other thing I promised myself was that I would put as much time and effort as I can into both the prep phase (and extra learning) and my time on-site. Failure to take care of my body will impair my ability to do so, therefore my resolve to uphold both these promises from Week 2 onward has been renewed.
